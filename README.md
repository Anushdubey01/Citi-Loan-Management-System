# Citi Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables from my internship in the Technology Analyst Program at Citi, where I had the opportunity to work on several projects aimed at enhancing internal systems and processes within the financial sector. The projects focus on loan management systems, credit risk modeling, and stock market data analysis and visualization, providing practical applications of software development and data analysis in finance.

### Internship Role
As a Technology Analyst Intern at Citi, my responsibilities included:
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions.
- Developing software applications that enhance operational efficiency and improve decision-making processes.
- Conducting research on machine learning applications in finance, particularly for credit risk assessment.
- Creating diagrams and documentation to support project workflows and system designs.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Loan State Diagram
- **Objective:** Create a state diagram to represent the loan management workflow.
- **Description:** This task involved modeling the various stages of the loan process using Unified Modeling Language (UML). The diagram includes key states such as application, approval, disbursement, and repayment, with transitions based on borrower actions and loan status changes.
- **Solution:** The state diagram was created using [draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/).
- **File:** [Loan State Diagram](Task1-LoanStateDiagram/Task%201%20-%20Loan%20State%20Diagram.drawio)

### Task 2: Credit Risk Modeling Proposal
- **Objective:** Propose a machine learning-based credit risk modeling system to automate risk assessment.
- **Description:** This proposal outlines a framework for incorporating machine learning techniques into the loan approval process, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of credit risk assessments. It details the necessary data inputs, potential model architectures, and evaluates possible challenges and limitations in implementing such a system.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Data Requirements:** Identified critical input variables for risk assessment, such as credit history, income level, debt-to-income ratio, and loan amount.
  - **Data Outputs:** Proposed output variables that provide loan officers with a risk score and recommendations for approval or denial.
  - **Architecture:** Explored various model types, including logistic regression and decision trees, evaluating their suitability for the task.
  - **Risks and Challenges:** Addressed potential issues such as data quality, model interpretability, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Task 3: Stock Data Query Application
- **Objective:** Develop a Java application to retrieve live stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Description:** Created an application that queries the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock price every five seconds. The application stores the retrieved data (stock value and timestamp) in a queue, allowing for easy access and further analysis.
- **Technologies Used:** Java, Gradle, Yahoo Finance API.
- **File:** [App Java.java](Task3-StockDataQuery/App%20Java.java)

### Task 4: Stock Data Visualization
- **Objective:** Implement a visual dashboard to display live stock data.
- **Description:** Enhanced the stock data query application by creating a JavaFX interface that visualizes stock prices in real time. The dashboard features a line graph that updates with each new stock price query, allowing users to monitor market trends effectively.
- **Key Features:**
  - Real-time updates of stock prices.
  - Graphical representation of stock price changes over time.
- **File:** [Stock Data Visualization](Task4-StockDataVisualization/Task%204.java)
